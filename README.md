Task 2

I divided the assessment of this task into two parts.
The first part evaluates the correctness of the code.
The second part estimates the quality of the code.

First part.

1. Response contains proper fibonacci number.
    We will check here if code works for edge cases and random picked number.

    * For fibonacci number with index 0, response returns 0. (1 point)
    * For fibonacci number with index 1, response returns 1. (1 point)
    * For fibonacci number with index 2, response returns 1. (1 point)
    * For fibonacci number with index 15, response returns 610. (1 point)

2. Program doesn't return a number for wrong input data.
    * For -10 as index of fibonacci number (1 point)
    * For 0.2 as index of fibonacci number (1 point)
    * For my_str as index of fibonacci number (1 point)

3. The URL address is as in requirements.
    * Address http://localhost/fib/5 provides response. (1 point)

4. Check presence of tests in project. Test enhance quality and maintainability of the code.
    * Code contains tests which pass. Tests logic is correct. (1 point)
    * Programmer used properly test library. (1 point)

Second part.

5. Each part of the application was written in place dedicated to it.
    * Tests are in tests.py file or tests/ folder. View is in views.py. Url definition is in urls.py.(Django specific) (1 point)

6. Computational complexity is optimal. (1 point)

7. Program has good variable and method names, which help to understand the logic. (1 point)

8. The naming conventions have been applied correctly. (1 point)

9. Code is clean. It's easy to understand. There is no redundant code. (2 points)

10. Code is SOLID compliant. (2 points)

11. Programmer knows Python. He used proper tools for given assignment. (2 points)
