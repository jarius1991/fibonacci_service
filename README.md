I divided the assessment of this task into two parts.
The first part is evaluating the correctness of the code.
The second part is estimating the quality of the code.

First part.

1. Response contains proper fibonacci number.
    We will check here if code works in edge cases and for random picked fibonacci number.

    * For fibonacci number with index 0, response returns 0. (1 point)
    * For fibonacci number with index 1 response returns 1. (1 point)
    * For fibonacci number with index 2 response returns 1. (1 point)
    * For fibonacci number with index 15 response returns 610. (1 point)

2. Program handles wrong indexes of fibonacci numbers, doesn't return a number.
    * For -10 as index of fibonacci number (1 point)
    * For 0.2 as index of fibonacci number (1 point)
    * For my_str as index of fibonacci number (1 point)

3. The URL address is as in requirements.
    * Address http://localhost/fib/5 provides response. (1 point)

4. Check presence of tests in project. Test enhance quality and maintainability of the code.
    * Code contains tests which pass. Tests logic is correct. (1 point)
    * Programmer used properly test library. (1 point)

Second part.

5. Each part of application was written in place dedicated to it.
    * Tests are in tests.py or tests/ folder. View is in views.py. Url definition is in urls.py.(Django specific) (1 point)

6. Computional complexity is optimal. (1 point)

7. Program have good variable and method names. They help to understand logic. (1 point)

8. The naming conventions have been applied correctly. (1 point)

9. Code is clean. It's easy to understand it. There is no redundant code. (2 points)

10. Code is SOLID compliant. (2 points)

11. Programmer know Python. He used proper tools for given assignment. (2 points)
